  <p>The recently published book titled, &ldquo;Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholar&hellip;&rdquo; by Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay has two main points. The first point is to explain Critical Theory, show how it has infected many areas of life, and make the case for why it is so harmful.

And their recommendation of how to fill the vacuum created by these anti-Christian philosophies are, themselves, very anti-Christian. Essentially, they believe in the concept of the &ldquo;ascent of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The danger for Christians, then, is that you may be seduced by th</p>
