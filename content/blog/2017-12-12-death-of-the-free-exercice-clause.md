The arguments presented in this case all center around free speech. The arguments are ridiculous, and everyone seems to know that the emperor has no clothes [except for us Christians.](https://warhornmedia.com/2017/12/12/bakers-yes-butchers-candlestick-makers-absolutely-not/)

What's at stake here is the free exercise of religion, and Christians aren't even showing up for the fight.

This case reminds me of Roe vs. Wade. That case hinged on the "right to privacy" instead of what it is *obviously* about: is that a human being inside the womb of it's mother, or not? Need I say it? If it is, it deserves all the rights and protections given to all other American citizens.

When the Son of Man returns, will he find faith on earth?
