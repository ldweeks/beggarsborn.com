**10/18/16 - 6:19am EST:**

I just received word from my mother that Papa Mbokolo was found alive this morning. Thanks be to God.
The funeral for Papa Pierre will be held today. Please keep the family in your prayers.

**10/17/16 - 6:45pm EST:**

I was able to talk with both my mom and my dad just a few minutes ago. My parents employ 3 guards every night: Papa Pierre, Papa Bokolo and Papa Noel. Papa Pierre has served my family for many years - he knew my grandparents very well. I&rsquo;m very sorry to report that he&nbsp;passed away in the hospital due to multiple gunshot wounds (may he rest in peace). Papa Noel was able to escape from the thugs, and he was the man who alerted the neighbors so effectively to come and help. Papa Bokolo is still missing.
My father told me that crime in the city of Mbandaka where they live has increased greatly in recent months. It sounds like this attack was just a bunch of thugs. There were 5 or 6 of them, and they were armed with AK-47s.&nbsp;There are now 6-8 Congolese police officers patrolling the property. My mother is at home with all the doors and windows locked. My father is there, also, but he may have further work to do tonight talking with family members and searching for Papa Bokolo.
Please pray

* that Papa Bokolo would be found alive
* for the family of Papa Pierre
* for comfort and safety for my parents

My mom just called back, and we spoke on the phone for about 10 minutes. It&rsquo;s five hours ahead where they are, so it&rsquo;s early evening for my parents and has been dark for probably around 2 hours. My parents employ three different guards. One of them came up to the house and informed my dad that there was a large group of people moving through part of their property. My dad asked the guards to go find out more information about what they were doing and why. My mom didn&rsquo;t know the details, but, eventually they heard shots, and one of the guards was wounded very badly.

My father went out to help the man who had been shot. I don&rsquo;t know the timeline exactly, but the first, short call I received from my mom came when someone was trying very hard to get into the house. The attempt failed, and it seems that the attackers have gone away.

Meanwhile, my dad is taking the wounded man to the hospital. It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes away, and the roads are terrible. My mom is locked in her house and in her room, and the neighbors are there. As you can imagine, though, my mom is scared. Please continue to pray for her safety, for my father&rsquo;s safety, and for the man who was wounded.

**10/17/16 - 2:56pm EST:**

Many of you know that my parents returned to the DR Congo not long ago. I just received a distressing call from my mom in which she stated that they are experiencing fighting in their area, and that they have locked themselves in their home. The call lasted for less than a minute, so that&rsquo;s all the information I have.

Would you please pray for their safety? I&rsquo;ll post updates as I hear about them.
