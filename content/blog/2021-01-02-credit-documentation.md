I saw [this post](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/credit-freezes-are-free-let-the-ice-age-begin/) about freezing your credit a few years ago, and I have referred back to it from time to time ever since. The problem is that actually following through with the recommendations is quite a pain.

Here's the short version (and no, I haven't actually done all this stuff yet):

1. Unless you're planning to open a new line of credit, you should freeze your credit and the credit of each of your family members at each of the major credit agencies. *I know! A **huge** pain.*
