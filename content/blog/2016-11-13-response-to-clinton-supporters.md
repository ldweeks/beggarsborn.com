As I've stated [elsewhere](https://warhornmedia.com/2016/09/06/20160905as-for-a-rogue-his-weapons-are-evil/), I'm no fan of Donald Trump. But I'm convinced that my brother-in-law, Joseph Bayly, got it right:

> Clinton has the stated goal of performing wicked deeds and making it illegal to obey God.

It's not too strong to say, in 2016, that a central goal of the Democratic party is to make Christianity illegal as soon as possible. [Christians who don't see that](https://warhornmedia.com/2016/11/11/open-letter-christian-supporters-clinton/) are either very shortsighted or actually playing on a different team.
