[I preached a sermon](http://clearnotebloomington.com/worship/sermons/2016/12/our-heart-opened-wide) on Christmas morning on the following passage from 2 Corinthians 6:

> 11 Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. 12 You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections. 13 Now in a like exchange-I speak as to children-open wide to us also.

God has opened His heart toward you through His Son, Jesus Christ. Open your heart to Him.
