I keep returning to a little work by C.S. Lewis titled "the Abolition of Man." I've read a number of things on technology in the modern world, and I've thought a lot about the topic, and I don't think I've come across something that gets at the heart of the issue quite like this little work by Lewis.

The work sold as "The Abolition of Man" today was originally a series of three lectures at King's College, Newcastle (University of Durham) in February of 1943. All three essays are good, but the one actually titled, "The Abolition of Man" is number three, and it blows me away.

It is a challenge to understand it, and so you have to be willing to put some work into it. I have read it numerous times, and I think I understand it a little better each time I read it.

One of Lewis' main points in that little work is that our understanding of man's conquest of nature is not so much an increase in our power over nature, but an increase in the power of some men over other men. Every tool we build that gives us the ability to "do something" is a tool that can be used by, or withheld from, particular men. 

First of all, I've been captivated by Jesus' words while in the desert fighting against the temptations of the devil. When it is suggested to him that He turn stones into bread, Jesus responds, "It is written, man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God." I don't know how to say this exactly, but I think this is something close to being "literally" true. We die - in every sense - if we do not have a word from the Lord.

This way of understanding the Word of God sounds New Testament to me, because of Jesus Christ. And so I find it even more mind-blowing that Jesus was simply repeating what Moses said to the people all the way back in Deuteronomy 8!

So I'm thinking about the word - not just about the Word of God, but also about words, generally. We live "in" words in a way that I'm still trying to understand.

But as I'm thinking about words, I have information technology and Lewis in the back of my mind. From front to back, words are central t Scripture, and yet we all know that words are less and less important to us as a culture. The image has replaced words,
