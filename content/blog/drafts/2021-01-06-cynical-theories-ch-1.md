In the first two chapters of *Cynical Theories*, the authors do a good job of summarizing a way of thinking that has infected and permeated all Western societies. That way of thinking is called "Postmodernism," and it's just a fancy-pants word for unbelief. With a couple helpful substitutions, the first two chapters could be titled, "Unbelief" and "Unbelief's Applied Turn".

In the first chapter, Lindsay and Pluckrose show how the fog of unbelief has clouded everything in the West. We've gotten to the point where we do not believe there is anything that is objectively true or good or beautiful. There is no universal common ground that we can share as human beings, and each one of us is free to determine who and what we are - all the way down to whether we are a man or a woman, or even a man or a monkey. Those who 




Those who identify as "postmodernists" are marked more by what they don't believe than by what they do believe. They don't believe their parents, the Bible, or anyone else for that matter. They use many words, but they don't actually believe in words, either. They sound smart, and what they say sure is complicated, but it all really comes down to unbelief. And unbelief is not complicated or sophisticated. It's as old as the hills, and it's as simple as sin.

Insist on:

1) Blurring boundaries
2) Power of language
3) Cultural relativism
4) loss of indvidual and universal

Argue in bad faith

The ideas have now gotten into our everyday lives - don't know which bathroom to use.

For generations now, Christian prophets have been warning us that this would happen. When we reject the God who spoke all things into existence and who upholds all things by the Word of His power, then we have no foundation upon which to stand. When we reject God and His Word, we are like blind men fumbling around in the dark.

Lindsay and Pluckrose aren't happy about this situation, and they rightly consider it to be a form of cynicism. The irony is that they want their foundation back... without God. They want to go back to the "good old days" where we had the trappings of common ground without the center.

Cultural Marxism and postmodernism vs actual marxism and its descendants

Pluckrose 

"The main tenets of liberalism are political democracy, limitations on the powers of government, the development of universal human rights, legal equality for all adult citizens, freedom of expression, respect for the value of viewpoint diversity and honest debate, respect for evidence and reason, the separation of church and state, and freedom of religion."

"These liberal values developed as ideals and it has taken centuries of struggle against theocracy, slavery, patriarchy, colonialism, fascism, and many other forms of discrimination to honor them as much as we do, still imperfectly, today."

"This philosophical liberalism is opposed to authoritarian movements of all types, be they left-wing or right-wing, secular or theocratic. Liberalism is thus best thought of as a shared common ground, providing a framework for conflict resolution and one within which people with a variety of views on political, economic, and social questions can rationally debate the options for public policy."

Two challenges to Liberalism: far-right populist movements and far-left progressive social crusaders.

Postmodernism is cynicism and unbelief. I can't know anything.

The authors rightly identify it as an attack on the modernist project.
