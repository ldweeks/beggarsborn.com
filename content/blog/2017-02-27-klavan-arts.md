I didn't agree with all the examples, but I appreciate the general point of [this article](http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/217934/crisis-arts-frontpagemagcom) very much. I discovered Andrew Klavan through his wonderful testimony, [The Great Good Thing](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Good-Thing-Secular-Christ/dp/071801734X).
