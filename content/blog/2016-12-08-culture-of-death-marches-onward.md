If you've been paying attention at all, you know that our nation is in [full scale rebellion against God and His created order](http://baylyblog.com/blog/2016/12/our-next-rebellion-against-god-self-murder-then-cremation). If you think this sounds shrill or out of proportion, you haven't read your Bible.

Just today, the New York Times, that gleeful chronicler of said rebellions, has the following headline: *Malta Outlaws 'Conversion Therapy,' a First in Europe*.

We must pray, and we must get to work.
