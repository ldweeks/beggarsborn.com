<p>I just finished John Steinbeck&rsquo;s <em>East of Eden</em>. I&rsquo;ve been working on it since early spring.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good book. The best thing about it is that it wrestles seriously with the question of our own depravity in a way that doesn&rsquo;t glorify or even excuse our wickedness. I&rsquo;m convinced that Steinbeck&rsquo;s knowledge came from a deeper understanding of depravity than even Evangelical Christians now possess.</p>
<p>Steinbeck&rsquo;s insights about motivations and desires really leaped off the page. In many cases, I had only recently learned about them by reading Dan Allenders book, <em>Wounded Heart</em>. In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure I would have understood what I was reading if I hadn&rsquo;t read Allender first. Allender writes about how the suffering we experience causes us to put up self protective barriers around our souls, and that&rsquo;s really the question that Caleb faces: is he going to love and live, or is he going to shut himself off in bitterness and anger?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much to like about <em>East of Eden</em>, but I probably wouldn&rsquo;t give it more than 3.5 stars. Why?</p>
<p>The philosophical foundation of the book comes from Steinbeck&rsquo;s understanding of the Cain and Abel story in Genesis 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 Abel, on his part also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and for his offering; 5  but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain became very angry and his countenance fell. 6  Then the LORD said to Cain, &ldquo;Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? 7  &ldquo;If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you must master it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point of the book pivots on the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>timshel</em> in verse 7, translated <em>must</em> above. Steinbeck believes it should have been translated &ldquo;may&rdquo;, meaning that we have a choice between good and evil, and we must choose the good. The two sons in the book inherit a whole boatload of wickedness along their family line, and Caleb must decide if his fate as a wicked man is sealed, or if he&rsquo;s going to fight to be good.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, though, that the ending depends on Adam Trask, Caleb&rsquo;s father, giving Caleb his blessing and releasing Caleb from the guilt he feels. So there is not just a recognition of or wickedness, but also recognition of the pardon we so desperately need. To live, Caleb <em>must</em> have his fathers pardon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s breath whistled in his throat. &ldquo;Adam, give him your blessing. Don&rsquo;t leave him alone with his guilt. Adam, can you hear me? Give him your blessing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s powerful stuff, and most surely better than much of the claptrap that passes for literature these days. And yet it&rsquo;s sad, since it&rsquo;s the last gasp of a liberal Christianity that has turned away from Jesus Christ. According to the <a href="http://www.oprah.com/oprahsbookclub/East-of-Eden-Timshel-Mans-Choice-Between-Good-and-Evil">Oprah.com page about the book:</a> &ldquo;As much as we inherit Cain&rsquo;s curse, we also inherit his ability to redeem himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Christless Christianity, which is like a ship on the sea without an anchor or a rudder. It&rsquo;s a kiss and a promise â€” or perhaps a hope deferred, leaving me feeling sick.</p>
