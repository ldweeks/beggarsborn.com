Update:
From ye old Wikipedia: &ldquo;A creed (also confession, symbol, or statement of faith) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets.&rdquo; We recite these kinds of things in our Sunday morning service all the time &ldquo;I believe in God the Father, maker of Heaven and Earth,&rdquo; etc." />

  <p><a href="https://dougwils.com/s7-engaging-the-culture/nodding-surveillance-cameras.html">Wilson is right</a>: the new &ldquo;community guidelines&rdquo; required of all users by Airbnb is a <strong>confession of faith</strong>. Of course, we&rsquo;ve been lying for years and accepting terms of service agreements that we&rsquo;ve never read, so we&rsquo;re well prepared to simply click &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; this time also.</p>
<p>The difference this time is that these terms are very simple, and we <em>have</em> read them.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>From ye old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed#Christian_confessions_of_faith">Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;A creed (also confession, symbol, or statement of faith) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets.&rdquo; We recite these kinds of things in our Sunday morning service all the time &ldquo;I believe in God the Father, maker of Heaven and Earth,&rdquo; etc. Before you can do anything on Airbnb&rsquo;s website, you must agree to the following: &ldquo;I agree to treat everyone in the Airbnb community—regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age—with respect, and without judgment or bias.&rdquo; Wilson&rsquo;s point, with which I agree, is that that is a creed, and they are requiring us to recite it with them before they allow us to use their service. I do not believe that Christians can &ldquo;recite it&rdquo; in good conscience. In Roman times, Christians who simply refused to declare &ldquo;Caeser is Lord&rdquo; could be convicted of treason and executed. This is similar, and it&rsquo;s only the beginning, so far as I can tell.</p>
