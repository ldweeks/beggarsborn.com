  The recently published book titled, &ldquo;Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Ruins Everything&rdquo; by Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay has two main points. The first point is to expose Critical Theory for what it is: a toxic and highly destructive form of cynicism that has infected many areas of our culture. The book starts by opening up the connection between Critical Theory and Post Modern philosophy. It then spends five chapters focusing on five distinct areas of study where Critical Theory has made an impact, such as feminism and Critical Race Theory. The authors then move on to demonstrate how Critical Theory is applied in the thing we all know of as &ldquo;Social Justice.

  I saw this post about freezing your credit a few years ago, and I have referred back to it from time to time ever since. What follows is basically a summary of that article.
tl;dr recommendations:
 Freeze the credit of everyone in your home for free (and forget about the stuff the credit bureaus are trying to sell to you). Notify a company called ChexSystems to keep an eye out for fraud committed in your name here. Opt out of pre-approved credit offers. You can do this for five years or permanently. (Why wouldn&rsquo;t we all opt out permanently? I can&rsquo;t think of a reason not to.

  I saw this post by Carolyn Yoder making the rounds on Facebook, and I decided to write a response.
Thanks for sharing this. I consider myself pro-life (I prefer anti-abortion), and I often wonder how someone with a tender conscience about abortion – but who would otherwise be left-leaning politically – thinks about the issue. Abortion is a touchy topic, and I have no desire to start a flame war. But I&rsquo;d like to give the following rejoinders to each of the seven reasons listed in the original article:
  Yes, we should all be consistent in our convictions. I cannot claim to love the unborn child at my local abortuary if I&rsquo;m unwilling to love my actual neighbors.

  My technological needs are mainly served by Apple devices. I use a MacBook Pro and an iPhone just about every day for my professional and personal computing needs.
However, for years I&rsquo;ve considered abandoning my Apple devices and instead using devices that exclusively run free and/or open source software. I&rsquo;ve spent more time than I care to admit considering what kind of hardware I would buy and what software I&rsquo;d have to use to do my work. And I&rsquo;ve done that because I&rsquo;ve had a sneaking suspicion that the free software crowd is basically right: it&rsquo;s really creepy to depend so entirely on a device that is at the same time so deeply personal and, ultimately, under someone else&rsquo;s control.

  Why we have to discover this stuff by reading a woman who is a lesbian and an atheist is beyond me. Kind of like having Donald Trump as our president. In any case, she&rsquo;s right, and it&rsquo;s disastrous:
 Second, the nuclear family as a standard unit of social life is a relatively new and isolating phenomenon. Wives returning from work to an apartment or house are expecting their husbands to fulfill all the emotional and conversational needs that were once fulfilled by other women of multiple generations throughout the agrarian workday in the fields or at home (where the burdens of childcare and eldercare were group shared).

  The arguments presented in this case all center around free speech. The arguments are ridiculous, and everyone seems to know that the emperor has no clothes except for us Christians.
What&rsquo;s at stake here is the free exercise of religion, and Christians aren&rsquo;t even showing up for the fight.
This case reminds me of Roe vs. Wade. That case hinged on the &ldquo;right to privacy&rdquo; instead of what it is obviously about: is that a human being inside the womb of it&rsquo;s mother, or not? Need I say it? If it is, it deserves all the rights and protections given to all other American citizens.
