      <description>My technological needs are mainly served by Apple devices. I use a MacBook Pro and an iPhone just about every day for my professional and personal computing needs.
However, for years I&amp;rsquo;ve considered abandoning my Apple devices and instead using devices that exclusively run free and/or open source software. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time than I care to admit considering what kind of hardware I would buy and what software I&amp;rsquo;d have to use to do my work. And I&amp;rsquo;ve done that because I&amp;rsquo;ve had a sneaking suspicion that the free software crowd is basically right: it&amp;rsquo;s really creepy to depend so entirely on a device that is at the same time so deeply personal and, ultimately, under someone else&amp;rsquo;s control.</description>
