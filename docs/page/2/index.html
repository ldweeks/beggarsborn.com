  The second piece to come out today commends this statement on Critical Theory and the Church. This is invaluable teaching for the church, and it must be shared if we are to be one, unified, brotherhood of believers.

  Two fantastic posts came out from Warhorn Media today. This was the first, a super-charged version of the Nashville Statement released on August 29th, 2017. Reading both side by side is very instructive. I commend it to you.

  We need to get off Facebook. A little teaser:
 What this means is that even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business. Facebook, in fact, is the biggest surveillance-based enterprise in the history of mankind. It knows far, far more about you than the most intrusive government has ever known about its citizens. It’s amazing that people haven’t really understood this about the company. I’ve spent time thinking about Facebook, and the thing I keep coming back to is that its users don’t realise what it is the company does. What Facebook does is watch you, and then use what it knows about you and your behaviour to sell ads.

  I didn&rsquo;t agree with all the examples, but I appreciate the general point of this article very much. I discovered Andrew Klavan through his wonderful testimony, The Great Good Thing.

  I preached a sermon on Christmas morning on the following passage from 2 Corinthians 6:
 11 Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. 12 You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections. 13 Now in a like exchange-I speak as to children-open wide to us also.
 God has opened His heart toward you through His Son, Jesus Christ. Open your heart to Him.

  It does seem ridiculous for me to compare this new Airbnb policy with the persecution of Christians by the Roman empire. We&rsquo;re not quite there, and so the comparison was over-the-top. But&hellip;
It&rsquo;s where I believe we are headed. Here&rsquo;s why:
 You have to understand what the statement actually means and not just what it says. Obviously, I can agree to treat everyone with respect. I can discuss sin, the judgement to come, and the gospel of Jesus Christ with a homosexual couple in a respectful way, just as I can discuss it with any other poor sinner. But that&rsquo;s precisely what this statement says I must not do.

  Wilson is right: the new &ldquo;community guidelines&rdquo; required of all users by Airbnb is a confession of faith. Of course, we&rsquo;ve been lying for years and accepting terms of service agreements that we&rsquo;ve never read, so we&rsquo;re well prepared to simply click &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; this time also.
The difference this time is that these terms are very simple, and we have read them.
Update:
From ye old Wikipedia: &ldquo;A creed (also confession, symbol, or statement of faith) is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community in the form of a fixed formula summarizing core tenets.&rdquo; We recite these kinds of things in our Sunday morning service all the time &ldquo;I believe in God the Father, maker of Heaven and Earth,&rdquo; etc.
